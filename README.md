> This Java program implements a text-based Tic Tac Toe game with a focus on clean architecture and SOLID principles. The code is structured into separate classes, each with a single responsibility, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. The GameBoard class represents the game board, the Player class represents the players, and the TicTacToeGame class manages the game logic.
